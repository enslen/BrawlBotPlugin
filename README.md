# NOTICE: 
I have switched over to the official API. The BrawlAPI team is discontinuing their unofficial API because they cannot access the data via a custom client anymore. The official API requires the IP address when generating their authentication tokens which is annoying but you will have to live with it.

2022-05-04: I don't really play Brawl Stars anymore and this is WAY out of date. Not sure how much work is needed to get it working. Good luck!
